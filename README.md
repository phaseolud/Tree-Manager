# Food Forest Tree Manager
This application aims to create a tree database for a forest garden (also called a food forest). 
The goal is that user can get a list of the current trees, find nearby trees using GPS and to log data about the tree,
for example when it's sick of deficient in certain nutrients.

The application is written with the laravel framework, with blade views. The breeze starter kit is used for authentication,
and Tailwind is used for the styling.
